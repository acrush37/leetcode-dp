    coordinate (0,1), the letter P is located at coordinate (2,3) and the letter Z is located at coordinate (4,1).

    Given the string word, return the minimum total distance to type such string using only two fingers.
    The distance between coordinates (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.
